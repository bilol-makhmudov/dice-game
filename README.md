# Non-Transitive Dice Game

Welcome to the **Non-Transitive Dice Game**, a console-based game that brings the fascinating concept of non-transitive dice to life. This game combines strategic gameplay with provable fairness using cryptographic techniques.
**This project is a challenge task designed to test understanding concepts like HMAC-based randomness, secure cryptographic key generation, and modular arithmetic, along with designing interactive console applications.**

## ðŸŽ² Game Concept

Non-transitive dice are a special set of dice where the relationships between them are non-transitive. For example:
- Dice A may beat Dice B,
- Dice B may beat Dice C,
- But Dice C may beat Dice A.

This project allows players to experience this phenomenon while ensuring fairness and transparency in every decision.
